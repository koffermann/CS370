<h3>Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: </h3>
<br>What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
<br> For this project, I was given the GameExperience.py, TreasureMaze.py, and the TreasureHuntGame.ipynb where I would add code to help the pirate AI find treasure. The other files helped to basically create the skeleton of the game, but the part I coded myself was what made the game operation. It is also where the AI was trained to go through several episodes of learning in order to understand how the game works and what the objective was.

<h3>Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:</h3>
<br>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
<br> Computer scientists study computers, software, hardware, AI, etc. and utilize the lessons learn to solve problems. This task matters because we live in a world where we are becoming increasingly more reliant on technology. As a result, computer scientists must study the link between what people want/need and how computers can provide that want/need. Technology has come such a long way that it can even be used to save lives. Knowing this, the study of computers is essential to improving our society and making life easier for everyone.
<br>
<br>How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
<br> I approach a problem as a computer scientist by first understanding what is ultimately being expected of a piece of software or hardware. This expectation is then broken down into different stages such as planning, coding, testing, maintaining, etc. Throughout each stage, the knowledge gained from studying computers is applied to the problem present until

<br>What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
